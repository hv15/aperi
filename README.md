Aperi -- A Wi-Fi Direct Demo
============================

About
-----

Aperi is the result of my dissertation work for my final year undergraduate
programme.

The application makes use of the Wi-Fi Direct APIs in Android
([net.wifi.p2p][wifip2p]) as an example of how to use them and what the result
is.

To Do
-----

Though the application is functional I want to add bits and bobs to it and flesh
it out further. I hope that in the near future it will:

* Be able to do file transfers from one client to another
* Have better Client-IP address storage and distribution mechanisms
* Use a more robust and secure way of transferring messages between clients
* Make use of a devices Wi-Fi connection to share an internet connection across
  all clients

License
-------

For the moment I have not decided if I should license this or release it to the
public domain. This hopefully will change soon.
